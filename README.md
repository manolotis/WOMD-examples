# WOMD-examples
Data loading and plotting examples for the Waymo Open Motion Dataset

### Requirements
I used Python 3.8.10

Install packages in requirements.txt:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Or manually installing a few of them should install everything needed:

`pip3 install tensorflow-gpu jupyter notebook matplotlib`



You will need to download some files within a folder "data" to run these examples
